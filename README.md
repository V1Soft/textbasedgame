# textbasedgame
An RPG-ish text-based game that currently lacks a title. This was originally a learning excercise, but now it's become something insanely stupid--but development continues.  
  
**Now an Official Repository**  
  
[Status: Active Development]  
  
Run textbasedgame.py to play.
./textbasedgame.py -h for list of command line arguments
